PROJECT TITLE: mnhaon

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To teach my kid how to code and share that code:

The constraints that we will try to follow...
- The source must be shared via github and in a compiled playable format with in two weeks.
- The focus will be on creating, experiencing and sharing code not the framework or deep syntax itself (so we will be using greenfoot, gosu or something like them).
- The two students will write all of the code using XP and scrum with an occasional booster script from me
- The two students provide all of the content: music, graphics, story and code
- We will have fun
